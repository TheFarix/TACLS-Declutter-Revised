#TAC Life Support Declutter Revised

Somnambulist had previously released a [declutter script](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667?p=1519118) that reduces the number of parts from 30 to 2. However, it uses [TweekScale](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80234), which I dislike and consider cheaty. After some time, I developed my own version that reduced it down to 6 parts.

##Requirements

* [TAC Life Support](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667)
* [ModuleManager](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)
* [Interstellar Fuel Switch](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932) **or** [Firespitter](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551) (DLL only)

##Enhancements from Somnambulist's Declutter

* Waste containers now start empty.
* Cost of containers adjust based on the type of container.
* The amount of resources in each container match the original containers.

##Known issues

Just like Somnambulist's script, this script creates a new part that can be configured. The original TAC Life Support parts will continue to function on existing craft, but will no longer be available in the VAB or SPH. However, any craft built with the life support parts after the script is installed will break if you uninstall the script.

##FAQ

###I like TweekScale. Can I still use this script?

Yes. However, scales are limited to 50%, 100%, and 200% to match the standard sizes. The top of the scale become avalable when the _Heavy Rocketry_ technology node is unlocked.

###Can I replace Somnambulist's script with this one?

Not without breaking your existing ships. That is because I used different part names than he did.

###I have a retexture pack for TAC Life Support. Will this script support it?

Unless the retexture pack copies over the original texture files, no. Because of the many different ways in which a retextures pack can be added, it is practically impossible to support them. Therefore, I will leave that up to the texture pack developer or the end user to figure out.

###I have a problem…

I have no intentions of supporting this script beyond its initial release. That is because I created this primarily for my own personal use and simply want to share it with others who may find it useful. If you have a problem, you are pretty much on your own. But if you have a fix, please post it and I may incorporate it—if my interests haven't wondered to something else entirely.
